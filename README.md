# Money_spending_tracking
This is the student's final project for the C-Women: Money Spending Tracking program.
The project creates a program that helps potential users to track their daily spending, categorize expenses, and monitor their budgets. 
Some people need help keeping track of their expenses and identifying spending patterns, which can lead to overspending and poor financial management. 
This program will help users organize their spending, see where their money goes, and make informed financial decisions.
